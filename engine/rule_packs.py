"""
rule_packs.py: the house rule packs a brief's "Safety and legal" section quotes (P3, ADR 0022, 2026-10-03).

A rule pack is one YAML file in engine/rule_packs/: the advertising rules of one market (ie, gb, ro), one
category (alcohol, gambling, food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar, charity fundraising) or one topic
(suicide and self-harm). Every rule carries its primary source: title, publisher, url, section and a
verbatim quote, so a person can check it in one click. These are not the knowledge packs in packs.py
(retrieval corpora); they are short lists of rules, read whole.

  markets_in(text, facts)   the ISO countries a brief is about, most named first
  load()                    every pack on disk, parsed
  match(markets, category, text, reviewed_only)
                            the packs that apply, each with only the rules for those markets
  line(rule)                one rule as a writer sees it: [R:id] (markets; media) rule (source, section)

A pack starts `reviewed: false`. Until a person has checked every source and set it true, a run uses it only
when BRIEF_RULE_PACKS_UNREVIEWED=1 (tests and trials), and the brief says the rules are unreviewed.
