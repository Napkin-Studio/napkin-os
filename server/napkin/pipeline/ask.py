"""ask: a person's question about the research, answered where they asked it.

The question is answered first from what the document already holds (its pins
and findings). jev then says whether that answer answers the question; when it
does not, or nothing could be said, the lens's researchers search with the
question as their focus, and the question is answered again over everything,
the new facts included. Without jev, the answer's own `missing` list decides.

The answer is written to `data.asks[<id>]`: under the section it was asked in
(its lens), or as a section of its own when the person asked about something
the research did not cover. Every sentence is checked in code like a report
claim (it cites pins or findings the document holds, and states no figure they
do not). jev's scores go in the decisions' reasoning, never on the page.
