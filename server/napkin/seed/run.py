"""Seed the category tree: research every leaf x lens for a market, into
napkin_category, as facts and dossier cells (Planner Research Taxonomy).

    python -m napkin.seed.run --dsn "$NAPKIN_CATEGORY_DSN" --run-dir runs/ie-pilot --market IE \\
        --verticals alcohol soft_drinks retail [--leaves alcohol.cider ...] [--concurrency 4]

Pause with `touch <run-dir>/PAUSE` (remove it to go on); stop with Ctrl-C or
`touch <run-dir>/STOP`; resume by running the same command again. Limits and
timeouts are waited out, never failed (control.py).

The research and model ports come from the same environment the middleware
reads (NAPKIN_RESEARCH_URL, NAPKIN_MODEL_*), so any napkin.research/1 service or a
production service is a configuration swap. Per unit (leaf, lens):

  1. research: one targeted search per group of the lens's measures (the
     measure list), naming the sources to try first for the market;
  2. check each page ourselves (pagecheck): a passage the page does not hold
     is dropped; the publication date comes from the page's metadata;
  3. extract facts (one model call) against the measure list: value, unit,
     qualifier, period range, the market it describes and how we know, each
     with its exact quote; a measure the list lacks is proposed, not invented;
  4. the rules check each fact (quote verbatim in its passage, number in its
     quote, a known market code) and layers.append_fact applies the dating rule;
  4b. corroborate: up to three single-source figures are searched for again,
     asking for another publisher; what comes back is appended like any fact;
  5. write the cell: a summary in our words citing only facts and passages it
     was given, every figure traceable to one of them, stored unverified
     (author agent). The database derives its confidence from the sources.

A cell that is already fresh is skipped and every call is cached in the run
directory, so a stopped run resumes where it stopped without paying twice.
One JSON line per unit goes to <run-dir>/units.jsonl; progress to
<run-dir>/status.json; a summary prints at the end.

EXTRACT_SYSTEM = """You extract facts for an advertising agency's shared CATEGORY research layer.
You are given ONE category leaf, ONE research lens with its standing question, the target market,
and sources whose passages were checked against the live page. Extract only facts a passage states.

Each fact is one of the listed `measures`:
- key_suffix: the measure's key_suffix, exactly. Use "other" only for something important that no listed
  measure covers, and give it a snake_case name in proposed_key (it is sent to a planner, not stored
  as a fact). Otherwise proposed_key is null.
- qualifier: when the measure's qualifier is not "none", what this row is about, as a short name: the player
  or brand ("Aldi"), channel ("digital", "on-trade"), segment ("18-34"), moment ("Christmas"), the statement
  agreed with, the rule, the body ("ASAI"), the wider market ("alcohol market"), the metric ("top 5") or the
  campaign. null when the measure's qualifier is "none".
- A measure whose cardinality is "many" is a list: give each item as its own fact.
- value: a number (value_number), a short text (value_text, <= 200 chars), or a yes/no (value_boolean).
  A percentage is a proportion between 0 and 1. Money is a plain number in the currency stated.
- unit: one of the measure's units.
- period_start / period_end (YYYY-MM-DD): the time the figure DESCRIBES, as a range.
  "2025" -> 2025-01-01..2025-12-31; "Q3 2025" -> 2025-07-01..2025-09-30; "March 2026" -> 2026-03-01..2026-03-31;
  "the year to June 2025" -> 2024-07-01..2025-06-30. Both null when the passage does not say what time it describes.
  The page's publication date is NOT the period.
- period_basis: "stated" when the passage itself names the period ("in 2025", "Q3 2025", "2024/25"),
  "inferred" when you worked it out from context (a comparison such as "compared to 2024", the publication
  date, the page around the passage). null when the period is null.
- market: the place the fact describes: an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (the UK is GB, Ireland is IE),
  EU for the European Union as a whole, GLOBAL for worldwide, UNKNOWN when the passage does not establish it.
  A figure for another country is that country's fact, not the target market's.
- market_basis: "stated" (the passage or its page names the place), "inferred" (e.g. from an Irish statistics
  office publishing it), or "unknown" (only with market UNKNOWN).
- evidence: the source_id, the excerpt_index, and the quote copied character for character from that passage.
Never compute, convert, or use outside knowledge. Qualitative lenses (codes, culture, positioning) produce
short text facts, one idea each. When `focus` is given, extract only what it names."""

you use in cited_ids. Never write an id in the summary itself: it is read by people. Every number you write
must appear in a fact or passage you cite. Never calculate a number yourself: no sums, shares, ratios or
percentages of your own. Say plainly what is thin
or missing. Name the period and the place of any figure (e.g. "in Ireland in 2025", "across the EU"); when a
fact's period_basis is "inferred", say the period is implied, not stated.
change_note: what changed compared with previous_summary, in one or two sentences; "First version." when
previous_summary is null. If nothing usable was given, set summary to null."""
